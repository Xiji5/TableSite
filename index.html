  <header>Dakoda Hawkins' 2022 Presidential Campaign For The Lunch Table</header>
  <div id="main">
   <article>I, Dakoda Hawkins, am running to be the first president of the newly established lunch table. As president, I will try to regualize trading food, and will even share my food freely upon others by forging rations. I will also try to establish a constitution and a set of laws that help support the sustainability and equality of our table. I am running as the main canidate of the Socialist Table Party, and as so, will help in benefiting the socialist ideology on my agendas which will improve our table. I also want to support the freedoms of the table’s population, so I will not do anything to obstruct peace not requested by the population. We, as a community, will host democratic elections.  I will stop radical political parties, by blocking their canidates from running in any elections. I am also willing to start a government coalition. For better representation of our table, I will be commiting towards a policy that bans any banging on the table. A punishment of not following this policy, and some other policies, will lead to no rations between a certain time span. I, if the first president, will establish no judicial system or military, as the president of the table will be the judge of all conflicts. The table will also have its own currency, flag, national anthem, and will have its official language(s) be the language(s) spoken from our communities’ people. More laws will be produced, like the official banning of write-ins. If absent, I will have another person be secondary-president (a president who can’t approve or reverse laws and do anything that affects the government), until I become present again. I will introduce other important policies of this constituting community from involvement of this community. The economy will be powered by our new national currency that, at first, will be handed out and awarded by involvement with the government and cooperation from the table’s people. You may spend the currency, preferably, by using the money to exchange in agreement with another person or party on something that involves the currency. I hope to become the table’s first president and lead to a serenity of solidarity with the people and for the people. Solidarity 2022!/article>
